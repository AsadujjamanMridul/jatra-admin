#### Your companion on the go

'Jatra' is a mobile app built with React Native, which basically provides all route information including fare and distance of all bus routes based in Dhaka.

## Overview

The most popular public transport in our country is the bus. According to the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) survey, the number of buses in the country 
in 2015 was 5407. In 2018, the number stood at 26,691. If we calculate the number of passengers travelling in this number of buses per day, it will stop at crores. For the 
convenience of many passengers, the Regional Transport Committee has provided bus fare charts for all routes from Dhaka Metro. However, the lion's share of these passengers 
is unaware of the exact fare of those buses that have been set by the government. As a result, they have to face fraud and deception. At the same time, there are frequent 
quarrels between the bus fare collectors and the passengers.
Here comes the Jatra app to solve this particular problem. Suppose the user has set the source and destination in the app and bus lists of that route. In that case, he will get the rout-based bus fare, fixed by the government, the number of traffic jams on the road, estimated arrival time and much more important information using Google Map API. If the user wants, he can use all the facilities offline. This Jatra app can be a valuable companion for passengers with overall bus-route information
